Overview\n\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for **classification and regression**.\n\nIts core idea is that **similar data points tend to have similar labels**.\n\nKNN is known as a **lazy learner** because it does not build an explicit model during training. Instead, it stores the training data and performs computations only at prediction time.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How the Algorithm Works\n\nThe prediction process follows these steps:\n\n1. Choose the number of neighbors, ( K ).\n2. Compute the distance between the new data point and all training points (commonly Euclidean distance).\n3. Select the ( K ) closest data points.\n4. For classification, assign the class that appears most frequently among the neighbors.\n   For regression, take the average of their target values.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Choosing the Value of K\n\nThe choice of ( K ) has a significant impact on model performance.\n\n* **Small K (e.g., K = 1):**\n  Leads to overfitting. The model becomes sensitive to noise and outliers.\n\n* **Large K (e.g., K = N):**\n  Leads to underfitting. Predictions tend toward the majority class.\n\n**Common strategies to select K:**\n\n* Rule of thumb: ( K = sqrt{n} )\n  >n= number of observations\n* Empirical approach: Evaluate performance for multiple K values using validation or cross-validation and select the best one.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Importance of Data Preprocessing\n\nKNN is highly sensitive to feature scales.\n\n* **Feature Scaling:**\n  Distance calculations are affected by magnitude. Standardization using `StandardScaler` is essential.\n\n* **Removing Irrelevant Features:**\n  Columns such as IDs or constant features should be removed as they add noise to distance calculations.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Decision Boundaries\n\nKNN creates **non-linear decision boundaries**.\n\n* With smaller K values, boundaries are complex and irregular.\n* With larger K values, boundaries become smoother.\n* Decision boundaries can be visualized in low-dimensional data to understand model behavior.\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as
